  That information is there to give you context, not directions.

//Note: Generic season entries were written with the assumption they would be used on days he is not working.

"spring": "6:10am cooks, eats breakfast at picnic blanket in yard/7am goes out to forage/11am goes to have a lunch with his neighbor the frog/12pm goes to school to teach kids about agriculture (if it is not a school day he socializes with any nearby Turnabout residents)/3pm listens to music as he walks home to cook/5pm delivers desserts and snacks he just made to everyone in town/9pm goes home to mess around on laptop/10pm goes to bed",

"summer": "6:10am cooks, eats breakfast at picnic blanket in yard/7am goes out and has a chat with his neighbor the frog/8am goes to forage/11am goes to have lunch with Lyell/3pm listens to music while walking to the waterfall under the frog then keeps listening to music while sticking his feet in the water/4pm goes home to cook/5pm delivers desserts and snacks he just made to everyone in town and socializes/8pm lays down on the picnic blanket in his yard and looks at the stars/9pm goes home to mess around on laptop/10pm goes to bed",

"fall": "6:10 cooks breakfast inside and eats it while he messes around on his laptop/7am goes to to saloon to have lunch/1pm goes to Cindersnap forest to collect forage and visit family/6pm goes home to bed",

/*/
Note: In the winter time he stays home as often as possible, lounges around, and generally does depression things like eat junk and live on the Internet, this is prime time for any NPCs to visit him at his place. 

I would imagine everyone knows about his seasonal depression by now, and given how helpful and kind he is every other season, some might like to pay him back some by making sure he's not lonely and is taking care of himself. (And who knows, some residents may actually prefer the company of existential nihilist Antoine over how he is normally, lol.) 

He would interact with them while they're there, and that would change his schedule slightly.
